            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHo soever thou art, If thy Soul is wrapt up in that Love that's with Christ in God, O then that I may know thee a Fellow-Citizen in that House whose Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is the God of Heaven; and now unto that Witness that God hath placed in thee, do I recommend this following <hi>Testimony,</hi> which I have written concerning the <hi>Works of God;</hi> whose Works have always, in every Age and Generation, been so amongst Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that all have been left without Excuse. And now, my Friend, although we may be but as Fools in the Eyes of the Wise and Prudent of this World, yet as we feel our Innocency to be so, as witnessing our Lives to be hid with Christ in God, we shall have cause to rejoyce. Therefore let us count it great Happiness to be accounted Fools for Christ Sake, and that because it is Life Eternal to suffer for the Sake of Christ. And now my Friend, O that we may stand fast in that Liberty whereunto Christ hath called us; That by Faith we may perform those Things which God requires of us. That we may not provoke him unto Anger, as those did that brought their Offerings unto the Lord, and Offered without the True Faith, therefore were Rejected, and the Anger of the Lord was kindled against them. And such was the State of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> whose Righteousness was Rooted in Darkness and therefore their Fruits were not of tender Love, but were Fruits of Anger: For their Righteousness being Rooted in Darkness, their Offerings were not acceptable to God; for they were in that State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had not the True Faith when they Offered their Offerings, and so their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was as <hi>Filthy Rags;</hi> and therefore except our Righteousness shall exceed theirs, we shall in no wise inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore let us look to our selves this day, and beware of the Leaven of the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> that we may wit<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess the Righteousness of Christ Jesus, without which there cannot be known an Inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven. O therefore that we may daily dwell in that Counsel which the Apostle deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, <hi>To put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof; for</hi> (says he) <hi>we know that if our earthly Houses of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God, an House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens; for in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be Cloathed upon with our House which is from Heaven, if so be that being Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we shall not be found naked; for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdened, not for that we would be Uncloathed, but Cloathed upon, that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality might be swallowed up of Life: Now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is God, who also hath given unto us the Earnest of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so my Friend, that we may know our Lamps to be trimmed, that our Souls may be fitted for inheriting the Kingdom of God; that when our Earthly Tabernacles are dissolved, we may truly witness <hi>the building of God, an House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens. For it is true, that Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</hi> Therefore my Friend, Oh that we may keep upon our Watch, that our Spiritual Man may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with that Body of Flesh and Blood that is subject to Passions, which (as is said) cannot Inherit the Kingdom of God. And now I beseech Almighty God, that he may prepare us for himself; so that our Lamps may be trimmed, that when the <hi>Last Trumpet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172224:3"/>shall Sound, and we shall stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ, and receive our Rewards in that day when the God of Heaven doth give unto every Seed his own Body.</hi> And so with the Blessed Apostle, <hi>O that we may know the Lord Jesus Christ to be put on, and not to make Provision for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lust thereof, that we may be capable to receive every one that is weak in the Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or not to Judge his Doubtful Thoughts.</note>
               <hi>and that not to Doubtful Disputations; for he that eateth, and he that eateth not, are both received.</hi> Therefore it is said, <hi>Who art thou that Judgeth another Mans Servant to his own Master, he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand. One man esteemeth one day above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; another esteemeth every day alike: therefore let every man be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in his own Mind.</hi> For as it is written, <hi>As I live</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>Every Knee shall bow to me, and every Tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now my Friend, I desire thy Care, that thou may'st diligently read over this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Testimony, and consider how the Work of the Lord hath wrought amongst the Sons and Daughters of Men from the beginning unto this day: and see how it was not any Work that Man could do of himself, by which he could come into an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the God of Heaven; but it was by the Powerful Working of the Holy Spirit through Faith, that Man came into an Acquaintance with the God of Heaven, and no other way. And therefore that we may not build upon any works of our own; but that we may dwell in the Holy Spiritual Liberty, it concerns us to be careful, and not to make a shew in any thing relating to Worship, But as we certainly feel the Blessed Faith of Gods Elect to be with us therein. And now if any enquire what this Faith is, and what is the Power and Nature of it; Ʋnto such let <hi>I. B's</hi> Testimony concerning <hi>True Faith,</hi> take place in <hi>Answer</hi> to their <hi>Query.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith is not an Historical Knowledg, for a Man to make Articles of it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend only on them, and to force his Mind into the works of his Reason; but Faith is</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Or a Spirit One with, or in God.</note>
               <hi>One Spirit with God: for the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moveth in the Spirit of Faith. True Faith is the Might of God, One Spirit with God; it worketh in God, and with God. It is frée, and bound to no Articles, but only to the Right and true Love wherein it fetcheth the breath of its Lifes, Power and Strength; and lyeth not in humane Arbitrium Opinion or Conjecture. For as God is free from all Inclination, or Deviation, so that he doth what he will, and need give no account for it; so also is the True Faith free in the Spirit of God, it hath no more But one Inclination, <hi>viz</hi> into the Love and Mercy of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that it casts its willing into Gods willing; and to go out from the Syderial and Elementary Reason. It séeketh not it self in the Reason of the Flesh; but in Gods Love; and so if it thus findeth it self, then it findeth it self in God, and to-worketh with God, not as to Reason what that will, but in God, what Gods Spirit will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now he who is the Author of this <hi>Blessed Faith,</hi> which hath been testified of, Encrease our <hi>Faith</hi> in Him, is the Desire of thy Loving Friend,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is the God that is only Good, who is Light and Love, and as his Nature is only Light and Love, so was that man that was Created in his Image; he was in the Nature of Light and Love, by which he was capable to abide in Heaven with his Maker; and to have Dominion over the Heavens, the Earth, and the Generations thereof; and as he abode in this State, the Holy Spirit from above was his Cloathing, and the Wisdom of the Almighty, that rested upon him; and in this State he was not like unto such, <hi>Whose Soul is pressed down with a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body, and whose Earthly Tabernacle doth weigh down the Mind; Insomuch that it museth upon many Things.</hi> But he was as a Tree that's Planted by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that spreadeth out her Roots by the River, and shall not see when heat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but her Leaf shall be green, and shall not be carful in the Year of Draught, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall cease from yielding Fruit.</p>
            <p>So be it observed, that Man in the Beginning was Planted a noble Plant, a right Seed, that he might bring forth fruit in his Season, and his Fruit would be to his own Comfort,<note place="margin">☞</note> being brought forth by the Divine Workings of the Power of an Endless Life, the Strength of which causes an Acceptance, the Offering being allowed of and received by him whose Name is <hi>Iehovah, who is the Strength, the Song and Salvation of the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Is it so that Man was Planted a Noble Plant, being Created in the Light unto Good Works, How comes it to pass, as it's written,</hi> That all Mankind by nature, are Children of Wrath, and under Sin, and are become filthy, in the way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>

And now Man being Created in his Image, the Question is, <hi>How are Mankind by Nature Children of Wrath.</hi> To the answering of which, it is needful also to observe, that the Holy Ghost doth say, <hi>That God is a Consuming Fire,</hi> (whose Vengeance is an Eternal Fire) <hi>Who com<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">

               <note place="margin">☞</note> From whence is to be understood, that the <hi>Wrath of God is Eternal.</hi> But mind, it was not a Consuming Fire, or Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anger reveal'd, <hi>until the Angels Sinned,</hi> &amp;c. Whose Disobedience caused the Judgments of God to be revealed and executed in Anger with Fury, and with Flames of Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now as concerning Mans Fall, the Scripture is not silent, but doth testifie, that Man was Planted a Noble Vine, Holy, a Right Seed in the Heavenly Power, whereby he was capable to abide under the Government of him that is this day the Ruler in <hi>Israel,</hi> whose goings out have been of Old from Everlasting.</p>
            <p>☞ But Man became a Degenerated Plant, of a strange Vine; or as it is said, <hi>turned into the Degenerated Plant of a strange Vine;</hi> and so is become a strange Plant, and a Branch that bares not good Fruit; and therefore the <hi>Ax</hi> is laid unto the Root of the Trees, and every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit, shall be hewen down, and cast into the Fire.</p>
            <p>Is not this the Fire of Eternal Vengeance that Causeth <hi>Indignation &amp; wrath, Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and <hi>Anguish upon every Soul that doth Evil.</hi> And now observe, that when Man turned from under the Government of the Heavenly Power, his Soul came to do that which was Evil: For his turning from under the Government of him in whom is (Glory, Honour, and Peace) was his Evil, and therefore arose in his Soul<note n="*" place="margin">Which was Gods Wrath Revealed.</note>
               <hi>Indignation,</hi> and <hi>Wrath, Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> and <hi>Anguish;</hi> under which four Woes his Soul was chained down, wherein he fell into the way of Destruction and Misery, being turned into a Degenerated Plant of a strange Vine, and so by Nature he became a Child of Wrath, and was under the Snares of Darkness. For <hi>Adam</hi> falling from the Image of Light and Love wherein he was Made and Placed by God Almighty, he became ensnared under the Chains of Darkness, and by his heavy Fall he sunk into the Prison House of Death, and became Subjected also to Vanity.</p>
            <p>☞ And the Reason only was, because he went out of that Order wherein he was, placed by God Almighty; this was his sin, and great was it indeed, so that he was changed, and in stead of Light, Darkness was his portion, and so he became a Child of Wrath, and the Day of the Lord became Darkness unto him, and he became wholly a Stranger to the God of Light and Love, in whose Image he was Created.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>By one man's Fall, Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men: For both</hi> Jew <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>are all under Sin.</hi> And this is that state wherein all are <hi>gon out of the Way;</hi> wherein, <hi>there is none Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; there is none that doth Good, no not one:</hi> From whence it is said, <hi>All have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God.</hi> So that consequently, <hi>All are, by Nature, Children of Wrath,</hi> under <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Darkness:</hi> And here was the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>God Revealed upon Man,</hi> and his Judgments executed in anger, in Fury, and in furious Rebukes. But observe, as above; That, <hi>As God is Light, and in him is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:172224:5"/>So, <hi>He is Love, and in him is no Fury; <hi>(He is unchangable, one pure divine Being, of Light and Love, Eternal.)</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Is it so that God is one</hi> Unchangable Being, <hi>of</hi> Light <hi>and</hi> Love; <hi>How then can it properly be said, That he is a</hi> Wrathful Angry <hi>and</hi> Furious God, <hi>and how it that is he Reserves the Creature in</hi> Darkness?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> To say that in God dwells Fury, is contrary to that Scripture that saith, <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi> To say that in God dwells Darkness, that is contrary to that where it is said, <hi>In him is no darkness at all.</hi> Therefore it is to be observed, that when God is called, <hi>A wrathful, Angry,</hi> and <hi>Furious God,</hi> and doth reserve the Creature in darkness, <hi>Executing in him Judgments in Anger, in Fury, and in Furious Rebuke, pouring out his Indignation upon them, and taking hold of them in his Wrathful Anger.</hi> This is that which is said, <hi>The Lord cometh forth of his place, and will come down and tread upon the High Places of the Earth, and the Lord shall rise up as in Mount</hi> Perazim, <hi>He shall be wroth as in the Valley of</hi> Gibeon, <hi>that he may do his Work, his strange Work, and bring to pass his Act, his strange Act.</hi> So now it is to be seen, that although <hi>God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all</hi> Although <hi>He is Love, and in him Fury doth not dwell;</hi> yet for the Transgression of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and for the Sins of the <hi>House of Israel,</hi> the Lord cometh forth of his Place, and through the Creatures Disobedience, he comes to be a furious God in the Creature; and a Day unto the Disobedient doth come, which is called, <hi>The Day of the Lord, whose Day is a Day of Darkness, and thick Darkness. This is the great day of Gods Wrath, which is Darkness, and thick Darkness indeed.</hi> So because of Sin, the Creature is bound under Darkness, and God brings to pass his strange Act; and he cometh forth of his place, and Reserves the Creature in Chains o<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at my Reproof; behold I will pour out my Spirit upon you.</hi> O here is the Invitation of the Lord unto Mankind. O what Vessel can contain the Wisdom of her that <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth her Voice in the Streets?</hi> who hath been a Place of Safety unto the Upright in Heart. O in the sense of her Blessed Call, Praises unto that God in whom she doth dwell, for his Love is over the Works of his Hands; and therefore when Man fell, the Invitation of his Love was unto him again; and those that heard, and do hear and obey, it is those alone that are Accepted: For his Love, by which Salvation is known, hath been offered unto all; for <hi>Cain</hi> heard the Voice of God through it, as well as <hi>Abel;</hi> For Wisdom uttered her voice unto him, but he was unrighteous, and therefore he went away from her in his Anger; he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished also in the Fury wherewith he murdered his Brother: For God is a just God, and no <hi>Respecter of Persons,</hi> and there is nothing wanting in him; for he so loved the World, that he gave his Onely Begotten Son to be a Light in the World, and to be his Salvation to the Ends of the Earth. Therefore all are left without Excuse, and if any Man perish, his Destruction is upon his own Head, and his own Burthen of Sins he must bear; therefore (while it is called to day) let none harden their Hearts; for God waits to be gracious at the Door of every Heart, none excepted: For the Way of Salvation (more or less, according to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God) hath been all along preached unto every one of <hi>Adams</hi> Off-Spring: The Way was preach't unto <hi>Cain;</hi> but <hi>Cains</hi> unfaithfulness to it, that was the cause of his own Misery, he living in the Evil Imaginations of his Hearts Lusts, and corrupt Desires, his Offering was not accepted by God; for having not laid hold upon the Blessed Faith, he could not offer his Offering, so as to be answered by God, well done, but his Offering became his own Burthen. But <hi>Abel</hi> heard and obeyed, and by Faith offered unto the Lord, and he and his Offering were accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering were rejected; but he was not rejected from the the predestinate purpose of the God of <hi>Abel,</hi> whose Will is, that man should be Sanctified; if so then he would not have said to <hi>Cain, If thou dost not well, Sin lyeth thy Door.</hi> So <hi>Cain</hi> being rejected, it was in himself, by reason of his Evil heart; for God is but One, as it is said, <hi>The Lord our God is one Lord;</hi> this is he that is said to be <hi>Good, and there is none Good but him.</hi> And now, as he is Good, he doth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172224:7"/>not fore-ordain Mans Destruction; but <hi>O Man, thy Destruction is of thy self, but <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Me is thy Help</hi> (saith the Lord.)</p>
            <p>And now observe, that from <hi>Abel</hi>'s Day unto <hi>Enoch</hi>'s, the Power of True Faith was offered unto the Sons of Men, and <hi>Enoch</hi> laid hold of it, and he pleased the Lord, and was Translated, being an Example of Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from his day unto <hi>Noah</hi>'s day, every one was left without Excuse, inasmuch that God shoured down of his Mercies upon them, and they did receive Good for Evil, and without question, they were by the Power of the <hi>Promised Seed</hi> forewarned of Disobeying what they knew or understood of an <hi>Eternal Being,</hi> and so were left without excuse.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Noah</hi> was found Perfect, and by Faith he Offered, and was accepted by God, for he was a <hi>Preacher of Righteousness,</hi> and by his <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> the World was condemned by him; and God overthrew the <hi>Old World,</hi> for the wickedness of Man was great: But <hi>Noah</hi> by Faith, found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord, and therefore in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange for the World, and left as a Remnant unto the Earth, when the Flood came, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and destroyed every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Substance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Only <hi>Noah</hi> and they that were with him in the Ark remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alive. Then afterwards <hi>Noah</hi> (by Faith) built an Altar, and Offered <hi>Burnt-Offerings,</hi> and the Lord smelled a Sweet Savour, and made an Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>That all Flesh should perish no more by the Flood:</hi> and place the Dread of them upon the Beasts of the Field, and upon every living thing, and he gave unto them every Moving Thing that liveth, to be Meat for them; <hi>But Flesh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof, they were not to eat.</hi> From whence it is to be understood, they were more subject unto the Life of the Creature of this World, than <hi>Adam</hi> was in the day when God made him, and placed him in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</hi> And upon this Scripture there is much to be observed; but to have a right Observation, it is needful to wait in that Silence wherein Power is to be known; to ask the Father to be a Partaker of the Eternal Spirit; <hi>For the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him, even that Spirit that Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Things; yea, the Deep Things of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now after God had Blessed <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, the World began again to multiply, and God left not himself without a Witness amongst them: But alas! the Imaginations of Mens Hearts being vain, they soon forgot the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vain in their Hearts, and committed two great Evils; First, <hi>They refused the Way that God ordained:</hi> and then Secondly, <hi>They went to build themselves a Way, which was a</hi> Tower, <hi>whose Top they would have reach to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ But alas! this was the Builders corrupt Desires, and therefore, says God, <hi>Go to, let us go down, and there Confound their Language, and the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the Face of all the Earth, and then they left off Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ind, and the name of that Place is called</hi> Babel, <hi>because there the Lord confounded the Language of all the Earth.</hi> And so here Gods Strong Hand was a witness for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and they were all left without Excuse.</p>
            <p>Oh let this be an Example to us this day, and that this confused People may be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172224:7"/>as <hi>Monuments</hi> of Unbelieving Souls before our Eyes. For they went to building, because they would exalt, and get themselves a Name, but the Name of the Lord they did not exalt. Therefore how inexcusable are we, if any of us should seek to exalt our Names above Gods Name, and our own works above the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Ʋniversal Spirit of God.</hi> Therefore let this be as a warning unto us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>and let us be passive under the Hand of God,</hi> that his Name may be exalted above our Names, that his Works may stand firm in our Souls, that all our own works and Imaginations may be confounded, that God may work in us to will, and to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let this be a warning unto the Self-conceited, whose Righteousness stands in a vain Imagination, exalting their own works, striving to enter Heaven, and not by the Way, Christ Jesus; and so would lead People after them and their wayes, and would set up themselves and their own works; and these are such that are unto the Church of God, but like the growing of <hi>Tares</hi> amongst the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after God had Scattered these Builders, he visited <hi>Abraham; and by Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>obeyed the Lord, and he looked for a City which hath Foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God.</hi> For the Promise of God was revealed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him and his Seed was the Blessing unto the Nations; this was the Seed of Faith, in whom man was Elected before the Foundation of the World: this Seed was the Promise of the Father unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and from <hi>Adams</hi> day unto <hi>Abrahams,</hi> the Righteous all pertook of it; for it is said by Jesus Christ, who is the Seed of the Promise, who appeared many hundred years after <hi>Abraham</hi> in a Body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of the Father, Abraham <hi>rejoyced to see my Day, before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am.</hi> This is he whom God hath Anointed to preach Salvation unto every one. And in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Day God visited the five Cities, and because of their wickedness God consumed them all; but the Righteous Man, God delivered from amongst them, for their wickedness was great; whose wickednes even unto this day, the wast Land that smoaketh, is a Testimony; and Plants bearing Fruit that never come to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and a standing <hi>Pillar of Salt</hi> is a Monument of an Unbelieving Soul; and this was for not regarding Wisdom, that this hurt came upon them. And from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Day unto <hi>Moses</hi>'s Day God worked many wayes amongst Mankind, so that all were left without Excuse; <hi>for Wisdom still uttered her voice unto all</hi> Adams <hi>Off-Spring:</hi> but those that would not hear were forsaken of the Lord. Now after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God appeared unto <hi>Moses,</hi> and did choose him to be a Leader of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that proceeded from the Loyns of <hi>Abraham:</hi> this <hi>Moses</hi> God made like unto the glorious Saints, and magnified him, so that his Enemies stood in fear of him, and the Lord caused him to hear his Voice, and brought him into the Dark Cloud, and gave him Commandments before his face, <hi>Even the Law of Life and Knowledg, that he might reach</hi> Jacob <hi>his Covenants, and</hi> Israel <hi>his Judgments.</hi> This is he whom God anointed to be a <hi>Leader</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore his Memorial is Blessed.</p>
            <p>Now observe, Although God called this People <hi>his Chosen,</hi> yet the Rebellious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172224:8"/>among them, he did not let go unpunished, but he was just in his Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as he was upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were not of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the <hi>Flesh:</hi> therefore when some conspired against <hi>Moses,</hi> the Lord saw it, and it displeased him, and in his wrathful Indignation they were consumed; for God is as <hi>Just in his Judgments</hi> upon <hi>Professors,</hi> as upon <hi>Prophane.</hi> Therefore how ought this to be an Example before our Eyes this day, that we may have a Care, and not sin against that Prophet whom God hath raised up, who is like unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> by whose Mouth God speaks unto his People, which is Christ Jesus, <hi>the Rock of Ages,</hi> by whom <hi>the Antients came to have an Acquaintance with the God of Heaven.</hi> And it is to be observed that altho <hi>Moses</hi> was the Man whom God spake unto in the Cloud, and gave Commandments unto, <hi>Even the Law of Life and Knowledge, that</hi> Jacob <hi>might be taught God Covenants, and</hi> Israel <hi>his Judgments:</hi> yet it was only by Christ that the <hi>Antients</hi> had <hi>Faith,</hi> by which their <hi>Offerings</hi> were accepted; <hi>And they obtained Witness that they were Righteous, God testified of their Gifts, for they did all eat of the same Spiritual Meat, and did all drink of the same Spiritual Drink; for they drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Christ.</hi> This is that Rock that God hath given <hi>for a Witness to the People, a Leader and Commander to the People, who shall call a Nation, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that knew him not shall run unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now observe, that although <hi>Jacob</hi> was taught Gods <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> his <hi>Judgments,</hi> yet they being disobedient, Destruction came upon their heads; <hi>and from amongst them God raised up his Prophets and Servants, and by them he often testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against their vain Imaginations and gross Idolatry.</hi> For the God of Heaven from his holy Mountain gave them Laws, he commanded them to keep his <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> and to observe divers <hi>Ordinances:</hi> But alas! they committed two great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; for they first, <hi>For sook the Lord, the Fountain of Living Waters, and then hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out Cisterns, Broken Cisterns, that could hold no water:</hi> and unto such the Lord by the Mouth of his Prophet did say, <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me? Who hath required it at your hands? to tread my Courts: bring</hi> ☞ <hi>no more vain Oblations,</hi> Incense <hi>is an Abomination unto me, the</hi> New-Moons <hi>and</hi> Sabbaths, <hi>the calling of Assemblies, I cannot away with, it is Iniquity, even the Solemn Meeting; your</hi> New-Moons <hi>and</hi> Appointed-Feasts <hi>my Soul hateth; they are a Trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them; wash ye, make ye clean,</hi> saith the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now how needful is it for us to observe these things, that they may be as Warnings unto us, that we may be fore-warned of the danger of making a great shew of treading Gods Courts, and our Lives the mean time to be only feeding upon that Imagination, which leads only into the formal Part of Worship, and not into the Power of that true Worship which is acceptable to God, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alone to be witnessed in the Spirit, and that by the Powerful Operations of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>And now observe, although God did call <hi>Israel</hi> his Chosen People, yet he was as just in his Judgments upon them, as he was upon the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> therefore well
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:172224:8"/>was it said, <hi>That one Day is with the Lord as one thousand Years;</hi> and by the same Apostle it is said, <hi>That God is no Respecter of Persons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him and worketh Righteousness is accepted with him, for the Word which God sent unto the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>Preaching Peace by Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is to be observed, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> have been visited by the working of Gods Mighty Power, although not in the same Form and Manner as amongst the <hi>Jews;</hi> for he who is said <hi>To be a Light unto the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>and Gods Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth,</hi> his Appearance hath been unto all <hi>Adams</hi> Off-Spring, insomuch that all are left without Excuse. For observe, that although the <hi>Gentiles have not the written Law in Tables of Stone, yet do by nature the things contained in the Law; these having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves, which shews the Work of the Law written in their Hearts; their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also bearing witness, and their Thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;</hi> for they are conscious to themselves of many Evils amongst them, and they have from the Beginning seen the Blessings of the Heavens, and have pertook of the Fruitful Seasons, and they have, and are convinced that they receive Good for Evil, and therefore they have been, and are all left without Excuse.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Is it so that the Law is written in the</hi> Gentiles <hi>hearts, and that they do the things contained therein? And is it so that God gave unto</hi> Abrahams <hi>Children Laws and divers Ordinances from his Holy Mountain. Its asked, Where the</hi> Gentiles <hi>or those called</hi> Heathens, <hi>have any Benefit by the New Covenant which God promised he would make</hi> with the House of Israel and the House of Judah; <hi>And is this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be witnessed this Day, in this our Age amongst Mankind?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The New Covenant that God promised he would make <hi>with the House of Israel and with the House of Judah,</hi> the same was fulfilled, insomuch that in the fulness of time Jesus the Mediator of it, he appeared in that Body which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prepared that his Will should be done in; and when he came, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that his Appearance was not <hi>To destroy the Law or the Prophets, but he came to fulfil them;</hi> and until all be fulfilled, not one Jot or Tittle shall pass from the Law; <hi>for it is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away, than one Tittle of the Law should fail.</hi> Therefore observe what this Law is, is it not the Law whom God gave unto <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, the work of which Law is written in the Hearts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as above is made appear; and this is that Law <hi>which Christ came to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, and not to destroy.</hi> And now observe, that wherever the Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are written, <hi>there is the Appearance of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, and that to fulfil the same, be it in the Hearts of</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles; for the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God hath made, which is for the fulfilling of that Law which God did give from his Holy Mountain unto his Servant <hi>Moses:</hi> this <hi>Covenants</hi> is Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, whom God gave <hi>for a Covenant of the People, to Establish the Earth, and to cause to Inherit the</hi> Desolate Heritages. (Oh the excellent Power of his Coming!) For his Coming is that <hi>he may say to the Prisoner, Go forth, and to them that are in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Shew your selves.</hi> Oh those blessed words of his Mouth, they shall not fall to the ground like water, but they shall stand sure throughout all Generations.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:172224:9"/>This is he whom God hath raised up like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> from whose Mouth the Law of Lise and Knowledge doth proceed this day, which is Jesus, the Mediator of the New-Covenant; <hi>the Power and Vertue of whose Incarnation, Suffering, Dying, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension, stand in force to this Day, and will stand firm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the End of the World:</hi> For it is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away, than that one Jot of the Vertue and Power of the Incarnation, Suffering, Dying, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ should fail, throughout all Generations. Therefore, O that we may not look upon Men, or the Sons of Men, but as Men, but O that we may look upon the true Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the Most High God: that we may know our Dependance to be in him alone; and that because it is his Lips that preserves People Knowledge. Therefore let us be warned to fly from Contentions, and in true Humility to wait upon the Lord Jesus, that we may witness the Vertue and Power of his Blessed Incarnation, Suffering, Dying, Death, and Glorious Resurrection: And this is the only way to get to Heaven, and not another. Therefore if any think to get to Heaven any other way than through that Gate which Christ Jesus hath opened: let such be warned, lest they should be found to be Thieves and Robbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Climbing up another Way than that which Christ the good Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd hath cast up, <hi>who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God: for which cause he is become the Mediator of the New Covenant</hi> that God promised, he would <hi>make with the the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;</hi> This is the Covenant that God hath established throughout all Generations, and it is in force this Day <hi>(for it stands Firm)</hi> and is fulfilled. <hi>For the Law of the Lord is written in the Heart, and is put into the Inward Parts.</hi> And God is become the Teacher; therefore blessed is every one that learns of him this Day. And now observe that the Gospel of Christ is that by which Salvation is only known, and that the Law of the Gospel is Life, from whence is to be understood, That as the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had not the Outward Law of</hi> Moses <hi>written in Tables of Stone, yet the Work of the Law was written in their Hearts.</hi> So altho many of the Gentiles, or those called Heathens have not the Testimony of the Gospel that is written by <hi>Mathew, Mark Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> yet they do receive of the benefit of the power of the Gospel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the work of the Law <hi>that is written in their Hearts,</hi> the same is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them, and that by the Power of the coming of him who is <hi>the Mediator of the New Covenant.</hi> So that they are conscious unto themselves of many evils amongst them, which the Light of the Gospel in them doth condemn, and if they do not harden their hearts, but keep innocent in what they know, they come to receive Peace and Comfort in that <hi>Grace and Truth that came by Christ Jesus;</hi> But if they harden their hearts against the Work of the Law that's written therein, and if they shut their Eyes against the Light of the Gospel, that would shine into their Understandings, they do become Sinners. And now seeing God hath so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited all People by the Power of his Son, it is to be observed that the very Heathens (so called) that are innocent in what they know they have bene sit by the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:172224:9"/>Power of the Second Covenant; For the God of Heaven, his Love being over the Works of his Hands, he did prepare a way for the Salvation of every one of <hi>Adams</hi> Off-Spring; which way is in force this day, and will so stand unto the End of the World.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Is it so, that God did prepare a Way for the Salvation of every one of</hi> Adams <hi>Off-Spring? How comes it to pass, that all have not been Savd from the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Darkness? And how is it that many in this Day are under the Bondage of Darkness? Insomuch that they do not witness the <hi>True Spiritual Libecty</hi> unto which they are called, and that by him who is the Mediator of the New-Covenant?</hi>

               <hi>First,</hi> Whether there doth not lodge in him a Body of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which is the Cause of that Cursed <hi>Desire,</hi> which makes the Heart eager to be exalted above other his Fellow-Creatures, which is like the very Nature of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> which was the first Beast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether there doth not lodge in him <hi>Cursed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy?</hi> wherein in the Anguish of his Heart, he striveth to trample his Fellow-Creatures under him, and to destroy their good Names amongst the Sons of Men: Therefore consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Second Beast. (A <hi>Bear.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether there doth not lodge in him multitudes of<note n="*" place="margin">Many Evils.</note>
               <hi>Spots</hi> of Darkness, in which the poor Soul is in dreadful Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, striving to have Dominion over every one, and will not be crost by any, but spitting his Venom upon every one that would cross him in these his Cursed Lusts. Now consider of the third Beast. (<note n="†" place="margin">Consider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Nature of a venomous Toad, whose Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is full of Spots.</note> A <hi>Leopard</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether there doth not lodge dreadful and terrible <hi>Fury?</hi> being strong in the Power of Darkness, <hi>So that he devoureth and breaketh in pieces, and would be exalted over all.</hi> Therefore consider what the Fourth Beast did, which was divers from all the Beasts that were before it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>The four Beasts that</hi> Daniel <hi>saw, were concerning four Kings, which should arise out of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore, Why dost thou compare the Sons of Men unto them? How art thou concerned to Search after these Things? Is not this the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which</hi> Adam <hi>Fell by looking after, with neglect of the Tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> My Friend, to the First Part of the <hi>Object.</hi> let me answer thee on this wise; Although <hi>Daniels</hi> Vision was concerning four Kings which should arise out of the Earth; yet it is my Understanding, and that which I have received from him, <hi>(In whom the Treasures of Wisdom do Lye)</hi> that the<note n="†" place="margin">Or their Natures.</note> Powers of the four Beasts doth certainly figure the dreadful Lusts that do Reign in the Members of Lost Man; under which, multitudes of Offences are given to God Almighty; which if well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may make one cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, Who shall deliver me from the Body of this</hi> Death?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And now my Friend, having answered the first <hi>Objection,</hi> and the first Part of the second, I am now come to answer the second Part of the second <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As concerning my writing concerning the State of Man in the Fall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is in some respect but like the Beast that perisheth. I do not write what I know not, but through Mercy, I know sensibly what I write, having through deep and tedious Travels met with <hi>My Souls Beloved,</hi> who doth faithfully open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me the Mystery of Salvation, and hath given me an Understanding what Man was in Paradice, and what he is come to be through his eating off the <hi>Free of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil.</hi> And now observe, Altho <hi>Adam</hi> should not have known the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</hi> Experimentally, but should have kept in that <hi>Holy, Heavenly Paradisiacal State wherein God Almighty placed him;</hi> yet seeing he fell through feeding upon the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> and with him all his Off-Spring. Therefore I say, <hi>It is now as profitable for Man to have a right Ʋnderstanding what the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is in it self, as it was unprofitable for</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>to know experimentally what it was.</hi> And for a Testi. mony thereunto, I remembr a worthy Saying of a Friend of mine, which is very suitable upon this occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ <hi>As the Physitian ought to find the Spring of Diforders in the Sick, or the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi> the Depth of a Wound; even so we to have a distinct Vnderstanding of that by which Man Fell; our knowing of it is as the spreading the Snare in the Sight of the Bird.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, my Friend, for a Close, Let me tell thee, that I have read many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of many faithful Men, whom God hath honoured with his Holy Spirit, which have answered unto the Spirit of God within me; yet in this my Short Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony for God, I have faithfully written what I have received from the Lord, and what God hath stampt upon my Soul. Therefore let all be warned not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172224:11"/>if they cannot understand some things. But wait upon God, and pray in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency unto the Lord, and no question but he will answer their <hi>hungry Souls,</hi> as he hath answered mine. <hi>Therefore Glory be unto his Name for ever,</hi> saith thy Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend, who is given up this Day, and am ready to give an account unto every Christian Enquirer, of the <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> that dwells in me, and that concerning the Blessed Power of the <hi>Incarnation, Suffering, Dying, Death,</hi> and <hi>Glorious Resurrection <hi>of Him whom God hath annointed to Preach Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth.</hi>

               <p>AFter I had written the foregoing Epistle unto the true Christians that are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> there was raised a Concern upon my Spirit, to write a few Lines unto all you that are true <hi>Christians,</hi> who are not so called: for my Friends, it is not to be called after any Name, that makes a Man a <hi>Christian:</hi> but the only way to be a true <hi>Christian,</hi> is, <hi>To follow the Footsteps of Christ;</hi> of which, I question not, but you are sensible of; therefore with you, through the great Love of God, my Soul desires to dwell for ever in the true <hi>Christians Life,</hi> which doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the invented Formalities of <hi>Sect-Masters,</hi> but doth consist in the Life of Christ, wherein the Soul doth enjoy the blessed Comforts of the <hi>Heaven,</hi> that waxeth not old, and that through the Powerful Operations of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> who is sent to be the <hi>Comforter</hi> of the Righteous in their Travel, and appeared, to reprove the World of <hi>Judgment.</hi> Therefore, Oh that we may always dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Love, and stand continually upon our <hi>Watch,</hi> so as that it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as unto the World, that is, <hi>To be reproved for Judgment.</hi> Therefore let us be on our Watch, waiting dayly upon God, praying for Power, that we may know a dayly Growth and Increase in those precious <hi>Talents,</hi> that God through his Son hath bestowed upon us; then I am sure God will take delight to do us good, and <hi>Set us as a City upon a Hill, to be Lights, shining to the Glory and Praise of his own Name.</hi> Then we shall be sensible to say, not unto us, neither unto mortal Man, be any Praise at all: <hi>But unto our God be all Praise for ever.</hi> And so the Lord will make us as Instruments in his Hand, not to do our own Wills, but the Will of Him that works our <hi>Salvation;</hi> so that we shall be, through the Love of God, as Lights set on a Hill amongst those <hi>Societies</hi> that we walk; and then without all Controversy, the Word of the Lord will often be as a Fire within us, to testifie against the Deceit of the <hi>Invented Formalities</hi> of those that would arise, and be as <hi>Sect-Masters</hi> over us, striving to impose that upon our tender <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> which our god requires not of us. But my Friends, let us stand fast in the Liberty unto which, by the Power of Christ Jesus, we are call'd: then we shall be able to say, as <hi>W. P.</hi> writes in his <hi>Addr. to Prot. <hi>Lay not Stress where God hath laid none, neither use his Royal Stamp to Authorise your Apprehensions in the Name of his Iustitutions;</hi>
                  </hi> as in <hi>p.</hi> 77. And so now my Friends, as we stand fast in the Liberty unto which Christ hath call'd us, we shall dayly know as Increase, withessing our Lives to be hid with Christ in God, wherein the true Blessing is. And then altho we may be called after the Names of several Visible Societies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom we walk; yet as through the Love of God we come to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the True <hi>Church,</hi> of which Christ is Head, we shall be happy; and then what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172224:12"/>need we matter the Names of the Societies that we are called after; for it is not to be called after any Name, that can make us happy; but it is the Life of Christ, wherein the true Happiness doth consist. Therefore well is it said by <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Addr. to Prot.</hi> pag. 177. <hi>That to be of the Church of which Christ is Head, the Redeemed, Regenerated Church of Christ is quite another thing than to be of any Visible Society whatsoever: for in all such Communions there are but too many that have no true Title to Christioanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> For the Immaculate Church, of which Christ is Head, is made up only of Holy and Regenerated Souls throughout the Societies of <hi>Christians.</hi> And now my Brethren, it is unto you that know the Work of true Regeneration that I write; and for you, as for my own Soul, doth Breathings arise, desiring our faithful Standing in those Places wherein the Lord hath ordered us. <hi>And so fare you well for ever, Saith my Soul.</hi>

Because, <hi>All Obedience</hi> or <hi>Service</hi> that is obtained by <hi>Force,</hi> is for fear of <hi>Wrath,</hi> and not from <hi>Love,</hi> nor for <hi>Conscience sake;</hi> and therefore will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so long as that <hi>Fear,</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> abides upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because, That by <hi>forcing,</hi> no man can make a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> to be a <hi>true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> but on the contrary, many may be made <hi>Hypocrites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Because, That in all forced <hi>Impositions</hi> upon Mens Consciences, there is something of the Wrath of Man exercised, which works not the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> but rather begets <hi>Enmity</hi> in the Heart one towards another.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:172224:12"/> 6. Because, That by <hi>forcing</hi> any thing upon Mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> as to Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> many are hardned in their Hearts against the things <hi>Imposed;</hi> when as otherwise, through <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>gentle Instructions,</hi> their hearts might be perswaded to <hi>willing Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Because, That <hi>Persecution</hi> for <hi>Conscience</hi> contradicteth Christs <hi>Charge,</hi> Mat. 13. Who bids, <hi>That the Tares</hi> (or false Worshippers) <hi>be suffered to grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Field</hi> (or World) <hi>till the Harvest</hi> (or End of the World.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. Because, <hi>Force</hi> is contrary to the End for which it is pretended to be used, (viz.) <hi>The preservation and safety of the Wheat.</hi> Which End is not answered by <hi>Persecution,</hi> because the <hi>Wheat</hi> is in danger to be plucked up thereby, as Christ saith.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Because, To <hi>Force,</hi> is inconsistent with the Belief of the <hi>Jews Conversion</hi> (and the <hi>false Worshippers</hi>) which is prayed for by the <hi>Publick Teachers,</hi> and cannot be attained, if <hi>Persecution</hi> for <hi>Conscience</hi> be <hi>prosecuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Because, They that <hi>Impose</hi> upon <hi>means Consciences,</hi> exercise <hi>Dominion</hi> over <hi>mens Faith,</hi> which the Apostle denyed, saying, <hi>They had not Dominion over any mens Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Because, <hi>Imposition</hi> upon <hi>mens Consciences,</hi> necessitates them to Sin, in yielding a <hi>Conformity</hi> contrary to their own Faith: <hi>For whatever is not of a mans own Faith, is Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Because that <hi>Imposition</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> wrestles with <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Carnal weapons,</hi> which is contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, who said, <hi>Our weapons are not Carnal, but Spiritual, &amp; mighty through God: and we wrestle not with Flesh and Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Because, There is but <hi>one Iudge, Lawgive</hi> and, <hi>King</hi> in and over the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> as the Saints have testified in the Scriptures of Truth; and whosoever would intrude, so as to be <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> over the Conscience, <hi>intrencheth</hi> upon the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Christ. <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>James</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="14">14.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Because, To <hi>Impose</hi> upon <hi>mens Consciences</hi> for <hi>differences</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Advice</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who directs People, <hi>To wait upon God to be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and not to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or <hi>Others,</hi> to be <hi>forced;</hi> who saith, <hi>Whereunto we have attained, let us walk; and wherein any Man is otherwise-minded, God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal even that unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Because, <hi>To force</hi> Mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> and to lay <hi>Yoaks</hi> upon them, is to <hi>make void</hi> the <hi>Bloodshed</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Christ, who sits upon the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and gives <hi>Liberty</hi> there; and commands us to <hi>stand fast in that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>not to be entangled through the Impositions of Men,</hi> or <hi>Yoak of Bondage,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Because in <hi>all Nations</hi> the <hi>different Professions</hi> and <hi>Perswasons</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> are either <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Governours:</hi> If <hi>Friends,</hi> then <hi>obliged</hi> by that <hi>Bond.</hi> If <hi>Enemies,</hi> then <hi>Christ's Command</hi> is to take place, who saith, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> which if observed, <hi>Persecution</hi> for <hi>Conscience</hi> will be avoided.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Because, <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>different Perswasions</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> was <hi>allowed</hi> in the Jewish State, as not Inconsistent with their <hi>Safety,</hi> and that in <hi>things</hi> contrary <hi>each</hi> to <hi>other,</hi> as the <hi>Saduces, Pharisees, Essaeans, Herodians</hi> with <hi>Others.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:172224:13"/> 19. Because, the <hi>True Religion</hi> cannot be Preached up by <hi>force of Arms,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> detested that Form of <hi>Proceedings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Because, No man hath such <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> of other men, as to lay a <hi>Necessity</hi> on them to <hi>Believe</hi> that which they do not <hi>Believe,</hi> or not to <hi>believe</hi> what they do <hi>believe:</hi> True Faith being the Gift of God.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Because, If the <hi>Magistrate Imposeth</hi> upon the <hi>Conscience,</hi> he must either do it as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or as a <hi>Christian.</hi> Not as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> for then <hi>Heathens</hi> (being <hi>Magistrates</hi>) have the same <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Impose;</hi> and so by <hi>Revolutions</hi> and <hi>Conquests,</hi> may come to give <hi>Laws</hi> to <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Comple them</hi> to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> 2. Not as <hi>Christians,</hi> for that <hi>Contradicts</hi> Christ's saying, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them; but it shall not be so among you, for all ye are Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Because, By the same <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> that the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of one <hi>Nation</hi> ought to <hi>Impose</hi> upon, and <hi>Persecute</hi> for <hi>Conscience,</hi> the <hi>Magistrates</hi> in all other <hi>Nations</hi> ought to do the same; and so the <hi>greatest part</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> may come to be <hi>Destroyed,</hi> there being more that <hi>Dissent;</hi> than are at <hi>Ʋnity</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Because, The <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and its <hi>Conquest</hi> over <hi>Falsity</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> is best <hi>Discovered</hi> by letting <hi>both</hi> have their <hi>Liberty,</hi> from <hi>Outward Compulsion;</hi> For no doubt had <hi>Outward Force</hi> been less used, the <hi>prevalency</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> had been more manifest, and that wise saying, truly experienced in the World, <hi>Viz.

               </p>
               <p n="24">24. Because the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are Rebuked by him for desiring the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> of those that were contrary to Him, and would not recive Him, which Zeal is sharply reproved in his saying, <hi>They knew not what Spirit they were of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Because, to <hi>Impose</hi> upon mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> and to destroy their Persons for <hi>Difference in Religion,</hi> is contrary to the End of Christs <hi>Coming;</hi> who saith, <hi>He came not to <hi>Destroy</hi> Mens <hi>Lives,</hi> but to <hi>Save</hi> them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. Because, People of divers <hi>Religions</hi> in one Nation, if not tolerated, must some of them be <hi>destroyed,</hi> or removed by <hi>Banishment.</hi> If <hi>destroyed,</hi> the <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Patience of the Sufferers</hi> for their Faith, moving Pity and Commiseration, makes men more ready to own, than to reject their Faith, and so rather multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, than lessens the <hi>number</hi> of its <hi>Professors.</hi> If <hi>Banished,</hi> this renders the <hi>Banished</hi> as so many Enemies abroad, ready upon all <hi>Occasions</hi> to disturb the peace &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of their own Native <hi>Country.</hi> There is therefore in order to the outward <hi>welfare</hi> of all <hi>Nations,</hi> a kind of <hi>necessity</hi> for a <hi>toleration</hi> in them of all <hi>Religions.</hi>

               <p n="27">27. Because, To <hi>Impose</hi> upon Mens Consciences, begets a hatred against the <hi>Imposers,</hi> in those who are <hi>Impos'd</hi> upon, and forc'd thereby to violate their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> towards God, in Matters of Worship.</p>
